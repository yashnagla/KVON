Creating a color palette for your Khatabook clone is a great way to add your own twist to the design.
Hereâ€™s a suggested palette that maintains a clean, professional feel while being user-friendly and approachable:

    1.Primary Color - Deep Blue (#0A47A4): This cool, stable color can be used as the primary button color
    and for headers, providing a sense of trust and clarity.
    2.Accent Color - Bright Red (#E63946): Adding a pop of red for action buttons or highlights will give
    the design energy and draw attention to key areas.
    3.Secondary Color - Soft Gray (#F3F4F6): Use this as a background color to keep screens uncluttered and
    make other elements stand out.
    4.Complementary Highlight - Teal Green (#3A7D76): This can add a fresh look to notifications, icons, or
    small buttons, giving contrast while maintaining a cohesive feel.
    5.Text Color - Charcoal (#2A2A2A): A dark gray works well for readability on screens, providing contrast
    against the lighter backgrounds without being as harsh as black.

This combination of colors will help you retain a professional look while adding some visual interest with
contrasting accent tones. This palette can also adapt well across light and dark modes if you want to add
that functionality to your project. Let me know if you need more ideas on implementing this design!
