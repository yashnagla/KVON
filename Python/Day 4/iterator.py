# The __iter__() method acts similar, you can do operations (initializing etc.), but must always return the iterator object itself.
# The __next__() method also allows you to do operations, and must return the next item in the sequence.
# StopIteration :- To prevent the iteration from going on forever, we can use the StopIteration statement.
