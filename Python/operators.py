# Arithmetic Operators
a = 5
b = 2
print(a + b)
print(a - b)
print(a * b)
print(a / b)
print(a % b) # modulus operator, returns the remainder of the division of a by b
print(a ** b) # Exponentiation operator, returns a to the power of b

# Comparison Operator
x = 50
y = 20
print(x == b)
print(x != b)
print(x >= b)
print(x <= b)
print(x > b)
print(x < b)

# Assignment Operator
num = 10
num += 5
print(num)
num -= 5
print(num)
num *= 5
print(num)
num /= 5
print(num)
num %= 5
print(num)
num **= 5
print(num)
