# Q7.6  Write a program using a user defined function myMean() to calculate the mean of floating values stored in a list
# def myMean(myList):
#     total = 0
#     count = 0
#     for i in myList:
#         total += i
#         count += 1
#     mean = total/count
#     print("The calculated mean :-",mean)


# Q7.7 Write a program using a user defined function calcFact() to calculate and display the factorial of a number num passed as an argument.

# def calcFact(n) :
#     fact = 1
#     for i in range(1, n+1):
#         fact *= i
#     print(fact)

# n = int(input())
# calcFact(n)

# Q7.8 Write a program using a user defined function that accepts the first name and lastname as arguments, concatenate them to get full name and displays the output as: "Hello full name"
# fName = input("Enter your first name :- ")
# lName = input("Enter your last name :- ")
# def fullName(fName, lName):
#     print(fName + " " + lName)
